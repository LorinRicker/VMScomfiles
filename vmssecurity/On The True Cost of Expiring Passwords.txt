On The True Cost of Expiring Passwords --

From "Archon", a commenter on Bruce Schneier's blog article "Frequent Password Changes Is a Bad Security Idea", https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/frequent_passwo.html --

    "I work at a company that recently dropped its passwords from 90 days to 60 days. The solution for the people in the 61-90 range? Expire their passwords right now! Can't have anyone violating security policy!

    "I told the PHB this was a horrible idea, he did not listen. Now I have 1/3 of 2000 people calling me and very, very angry."

"Archon"'s anecdote is the real world.  Few people understand, or calculate, the True Cost of expiring passwords. Many sys-admins do.  Business weenies and Dilbert's pointy-haired manager do not.

Consider this (not so fictional) user's story:

Joe User (no sexism intended -- "Joe" could be "Jo") comes to work on his/her regular shift, and, as s/he does every day, turns to (okay, enough P.C...) his terminal (usually, now-a-days, a terminal emulator on his workstation's desktop, and could be in a cubicle or on the factory floor, etc.) to log(in/on)/sign(on/in) to his application computer system (Unix, Linux, OpenVMS, mainframe or other).  Note that computer access is essential to his work and job performance.

He enters his...
Username: juser
and his...
Password: **********

Bang!  Computer responds with "Your password has expired!" and forces Joe into the dreaded Password-Dialogue-From-Hell.

Joe...

    * Palms his forehead, raising a welt (this could be sufficient cause to file an accident report).
    * Mumbles a profanity at the terminal.  Poor terminal (this also could be grounds for an incident report.)
    * Stares dumbly at the blinking cursor for some period of time.
    * Swears again.
    * Pushes his chair back.
    * Stands up abruptly, causing his chair to tip over (possibly grounds for another accident report).
    * Walks down the hall to the restroom, hoping to think of a new password.
    * Returns from the restroom, thinking happily about his crafty new secret password.
    * Notes that his terminal has timed-out.  Starts the whole log(in/on)/sign(on/in) process afresh.
    * Is confused about whether to enter his old password again in response to the password prompt...
    * While he's thinking about this, his terminal session times-out again.
    * Swears...
    * Starts over again.
    * Still confused, but say's "To hell with it..." and enters his old password.
    * Gets the "Please enter a new password:" prompt again.
    * Has forgotten his crafty new secret password.
    * Stares at the terminal for "a long time"...
    * Terminal session times-out again.
    * Curses... A prim, proper, timid yet politically-correct colleague across the aisle files a formal online complaint against him.
    * Starts over again.
    * Recovers his train of thought from the restroom trip, and happily enters his crafty new secret password when the system demands "Please enter a new password:".
    * System responds: "That password is found in the proscribed dictionary.  Please enter a new password:"
    * He says "Huh?"
    * System times-out again.
    * Curses...
    * Throws his pencil at the wall...
    * P.C. colleague picks up the phone to call the designated HR representative for sexual harassment and workplace violence.
    * Starts over again.
    * "Please enter a new password:"
    * Types in the first thing that occurs to him.
    * System responds: "Password is too easy to guess. Please enter another string."
    * "...another string??!!! I thought this was a password thing..." Another profanity.
    * System is really slow, so he has time to think up yet-another-password.
    * Enters his new-new password when prompted "Please enter a new password:"
    * System responds: "The entered password does not meet complexity requirements.  Please enter a new password:"
    * Curses...
    * Swears...
    * Slams keyboard on desk...
    * P.C. colleague calls the cops; SWAT team is dispatched, but cannot get past the building entrance security guards.
    * Calms down a bit when his PH-manager-supervisor walks over to see what's wrong.
    * Takes deep breaths and explains his problem.
    * Supervisor advises him to call the Help Desk.
    * Calls Help Desk, listens to five minutes of Karen Carpenter's "Close To You"... mutters a counterpoint of profanities under his breath.
    * "Hello, this is Roger in Kansas City, how can I help you?" (in reality, Rajesh in Bombay; he can tell from the accent).
    * Explains his problem.  "Roger" doesn't get it, and tells him to "Please to reboot your PC."
    * Swears... "Roger" doesn't get that either.
    * Calms down... Tries to patiently explain to "Roger" that he needs help to reset his password.
    * "Roger" finally asks him "Which system?"  When "Roger" finally understands that the system in question is an applications system and "not Windows", explains that he cannot help.
    * Curses... Swears... Slams phone... Verging on hyperventilation... et cetera...
    * P.C. colleague is now hiding under desk, quietly praying agnostically.
    * Supervisor swings by again, remarks that the Help Desk is really for Windows-only problems, and advises that he call the application system's administrator, helpfully providing the phone number.
    * Calls system administrator.
    * Gets voice mail.
    * Leaves voice mail, peppered with profanity.
    * Gets up and goes to coffee room.  Spends about an hour telling colleagues about his problems, including the password expired problem.
    * Gets call-back from sys-admin, who patiently explains the password policy.  "All passwords must exceed eight characters, but not thirty-two characters, and must contain mixed-case letters, numbers, no more than two special characters, at least one emoji, with bonus points for using porpoise noises or an approved Ameslan sign language dialect."
    * Listens silently, while his eyeballs spin in counter-directions.
    * Asks the sys-admin: "Would Xyzzy&796%fooBar" be an acceptable password.  Sys-admin says: "Yes, it would, except it lacks porpoise sounds, and you cannot use it because you've told me what it is. If you use it, we'd have to shoot you.  Heh-heh."
    * Joe: grimaces.
    * "Ya know," the sys-admin goes on, "I volunteered to join the Security Policy Committee, just to try to keep things from goin' crazy."
    * "Yeah, right," Joe mutters.  Sys-admin doesn't seem to notice, continues: "One gal on the committee, she heard somewhere that -- get this -- She says it with a straight face: The most secure computer system is one that's unplugged and put in a Faraday cage, encased in concrete, and then dumped into the Marianas Trench.  She's serious! Then she allows as that might be going too far for our own company systems. But then she asks: 'Why don't we unplug ours and just run them on batteries?'  See whad'I mean?..."
    * Joe: "You're kidding me, right?"
    * Sys-admin: "Nope.  I'm serious.  Y'all are lucky I'm on the Committee. 'S'a matter of fact, I'm authorized to make you a one-time offer and deal, bein' as you're updating your password today'n all."
    * Joe: "A deal. Okay, I'll bite.  What deal?"
    * Sys-admin: "Well, the Committee's fixin' to release an updated Policy next week, and that'n will make passwords expire weekly."
    * Joe, incredulous: "What!?! Wait, man... Hell, we'll never get logged in to get any work done!"
    * Sys-admin: "Yah, that's been discussed as an issue, but the way the Committee figures it, if we can get to that point, we'll likely get a Full Compliance Security Rating in our next SOX Audit. Then they say they'll release our daughters."
    * Joe:  "Wait...what?! Daughters? Who's daughters?"
    * Sys-admin: "It was a condition for joining the Policy Committee. They're holding our girls as hostage... er, in escrow, as an inducement to getting our internal systems all into compliance. They're all staying in a dormitory over at the convent, the Sisters of Perpetual Expiration. I hear they're doing pretty good, the nuns have them working as human computers on a project to simulate breaking something called Enigma, whatever that is. Seem to be enjoying it; last time I talked to Sammi, they were all calling themselves the 'P.C.s'"
    * Joe: "Um, is this okay with you?"
    * Sys-Admin: "Oh, yeah, sure. Every team needs a bit of motivational inspiration every now and then. The Board of Directors has promised us that if we get to full compliance before Christmas this year, they'll even release our year-end bonuses!"
    * Joe: Doesn't know quite what to say...
    * Sys-admin: "Hey, I almost forgot! Back to your deal! Since your password expired today, I'm authorized to make you this one-time limited offer: If you actually manage to get your password reset today by close of business, you'll be automatically grandfathered into the 30-day password expiration cycle for the rest of the year, rather than getting pulled into the new 7-day limit."
    * Joe: "So, if I don't get my password changed today, I'm gonna have to do this every week?"
    * Sys-admin: "Yup, that's right."
    * Joe: "Hell, man, this is messed up. What if I don't?"
    * Sys-admin: "Which what? Don't get it changed today, or don't like changing it weekly?"
    * Joe: "Well, either one?"
    * Sys-admin: "Well, then that'd be a violation. We'd have to shoot you. Heh-heh."
    * Joe: "C'mon, man, get serious. I mean, look... What if I just stay logged-on, never log-off, and just throw a blanket over my terminal so no-one can tell?"
    * Sys-admin: "Well, then that'd be a violation. We'd have to kill you."
    * Joe: "You're jokin' again, right?"
    * Sys-admin: "No, not this time. But fortunately, we're installing Cisco's new Enterprise Inactive Process Crusher to monitor and kill interactive sessions like yours. It'll kill your session whenever you go to lunch, whenever you go to the restroom, and at shift-end. If you don't get your password reset today, you'll likely never logon again."
    * Sighs... Says "Thanks for the help, man..." and hangs up.
    * Thus forewarned, prepared and comprehending (not really), thinks hard about his trusty old password, remembers that it's got a "4" in it, decides to change the "4" into a "5" and hope for the best...
    * Starts over...
    * This time, when prompted "Please enter a new password:", enters his old password with the "5" substituted for the "4", hits the Enter key and prays.
    * System responds: "Please confirm the new password:"
    * Yes!  Overjoyed, enters his new-new-new password, but with the "4"...
    * System responds: "Passwords do not match.  Please enter a new password:"
    * Swears, et cetera...
    * P.C. colleague is crawling on the floor towards the nearest exit. Much shouting can be heard from the vicinity of the building entrance.
    * ... "Please enter a new password:"
    * Enters his new-new-new password with the "5"...
    * "Please confirm the new password:"
    * Using only his two index fingers, carefully and slowly starts typing his new-new-new password again...
    * Before he's done, system responds with "Time-out expired."
    * Tears come to his eyes.
    * To no-one in particular, shouts "If this doesn't work this time, I'm gonna..."
    * Starts over, one last time...
    * "Please enter a new password:"
    * Enters his new-new-new password with the "5"...
    * "Please confirm the new password:"
    * A bit more quickly, but still with two index fingers, types his new-new-new password again, sounding it out silently, remembering to use the "5" instead of the "4".
    * System hesitates, then responds: ... "Password has been changed successfully."
    * Erupts from his chair with shouts of triumph.
    * Immediately writes his new-new-new password onto a Post-It Note with a red Sharpie, and tapes it to his workstation's screen in the upper-right corner. Uses tape on all four edges so it won't blow away.
    * Finally gets to work... but is a basketcase for the rest of the day.
    * Later that afternoon, receives an email from "the Corporate Security Team" stating that: "Due to our improved security policy, your network access password will expire in 7 days. Failure to update your network password within this timeframe will result in loss of network access, plus a mandatory remedial system security retraining class which must be completed no later than 30 days from the date of the infraction."
    * Joe is restrained in a straight-jacket and forcibly removed from the premises by building security.
    * ...90 days later...

Now, please tell me your own estimate for the amount of time that the above scenario might actually take in wall-clock time.  If you find argument/disagreement with this story, then make up your own... But be realistic. It's not fair to dismiss this with the belief that "changing a password only takes a few seconds."  The above story is, in my opinion and by observation, far closer to the truth.

Then, imagine this (mine or yours) happening, with major and minor variations, thousands of times per day, hundreds of thousands of times per month, around the country and the globe.

Is any "Password Expiration Security Policy" worth this true cost?
